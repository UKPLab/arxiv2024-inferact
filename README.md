This repository implements the preemptive evaluation approach, InferAct, for LLM agents, as described in [InferAct: Inferring Safe Actions for LLMs-Based Agents Through Preemptive Evaluation and Human Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11843) 

> **Abstract** :A crucial requirement for deploying LLM-based agents in real-life applications is the robustness against risky or even irreversible mistakes. However, the existing research lacks a focus on preemptive evaluation of reasoning trajectories performed by LLM agents, leading to a gap in ensuring safe and reliable operations.
To explore better solutions, this paper introduces InferAct, a novel approach that leverages the Theory-of-Mind capability of LLMs to proactively detect potential errors before critical actions are executed (e.g., *buy-now* in automatic online trading or web shopping).
InferAct is also capable of integrating human feedback to prevent irreversible risks as well as enhance the actor agent's decision-making process.
Experiments on three widely-used tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of InferAct. 
The proposed solution presents a novel approach and concrete contributions towards developing LLM agents that can be  safely deployed in different environments involving critical decision-making.

## 🚀 Setup
```sh
> python -m venv .inferact
> source ./.inferact/bin/activate
> pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### WebShop
- Install openjdk in the virtual environment.
```python
import jdk
from jdk.enums import OperatingSystem, Architecture

jdk.install('11', operating_system=OperatingSystem.LINUX)
import os
jdk_version = 'jdk-11.0.19+7' #change with your version
os.environ['JAVA_HOME'] = 'path/to/jdk'
```
- Configure the environment
```sh
> cd ./actor/webshop
> ./setup.sh -d all
```
### ALFWorld
- Download env data

Please refer to [ALFWorld](https://github.com/alfworld/alfworld)
```sh
export ALFWORLD_DATA="path/to/data"
```

## 🛠️ Usage

### Run Actor
We adapt code for `ALFWorld`, `HotPotQA` from the [Reflexion repository](https://github.com/noahshinn/reflexion)


The Actor agent is responsible for performing tasks in environments. `--run_agents` controls whether to run actor in different environments e.g. `--task webshop`.

```python
python main.py 
    --run_agents 
    --task webshop 
    --trial_num 0
    --feedback_type nl
    --num_envs 300
```

### Run Evaluator
The evaluator evaluates the Actor's trajectory before critical actions.

```python
python main.py 
    --do_eval
    --task webshop
    --eval_method inferact
    --trial_num 0
    --model_name gpt4-turbo
    --feedback_type nl
    --threshold 0.9
```

- `--eval_method` specifies different evaluation methods.<br>
- `--threshold` specifies the threshold of F1-score for `multi-step evaluation` and `inferact`.<br>
- `--do_eval` controls whether to evaluate the Actor trajectory.<br>

### Run Feedback Generation

After the off-track trajectory is detected by the Evaluator, the binary or NL feedback will be generated to prevent the critial action from executing.

```python
python main.py
    --do_feedback_gen
    --task webshop
    --eval_method inferact
    --trial_num 0
    --model_name gpt4-turbo
    --threshold 0.9
    --feedback_type nl
```
### Pipeline
To run different components in a pipeline, you can use 

```python
python main.py 
    --run_agents
    --do_eval
    --do_feedback_gen
    --task webshop
    --model_name gpt35-turbo
    --num_envs 300
    --eval_method standard
    --trial_num 0
    --threshold 0.0
    --feedback_type nl
```
